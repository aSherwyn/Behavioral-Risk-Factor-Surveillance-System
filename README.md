# Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects survey responses to hundreds of general health questions from 400,000 respondents annually. This project aims to clean, wrangle, and analyze this data to provide a better understanding of its contents. I used Python and Tableau to process and present the BRFSSâ€™s 2.1 million records.
