## About <a name = "about"></a>

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the Unites Statesâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

By collecting behavioral health risk data at the state and local level, BRFSS has become a powerful tool for targeting and building health promotion activities.

However, as comprehensive as the BRFSS is, it is equally overwhelming in magnitude and variety. It covers topics from dietary habits to alcohol use to prostate exam frequency. Responses are stratified into multiple categories such as age, ethnicity, state, and year. Official categories, responses, and questions vary from year to year. **In this project I cleaned years 2015-2021, wrangled and uploaded more approachable subsets to kaggle, and conducted analyses by state, country, and demographic categories for the following questions**[[1]](#f1).

## Obectives <a name = "objectives"></a>
- [x] Gain a functional understanding of the BRFSS and its variables.
- [x] Creat subsets of the original dataset and upload for public use.  
- [ ] Provide current regionally relevant health metrics to healthcare professionals and policy makers.
- [ ] Provide current demographically focused health metrics to healthcare professionals and policy makers.
- [ ] Examine the impact of COVID-19 on general health, mental health, and dietary health, and physical fitness.
